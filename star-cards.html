                        <h4>Social Worker</h4>
                        <p>This is one of the first people you will meet. A social worker is a person who
                            works for a local authority- the council children’s social services. Their role is to make
                            sure
                            children- anyone who is under 18 in the UK- are well taken care of when they have nowhere to
                            live and their parents are not present and cannot take care of them. This means your social
                            worker will make sure you have a place to live, a family or people to take care of you daily
                            and
                            give you food and clothing, that you go to school or college, and that you see a doctor or
                            dentist when you first arrive. They will also ensure you have a solicitor for your asylum
                            claim.
                            Your social worker will write all of this in a document called a care plan and should always
                            ask
                            you for your opinion about every part of your plan. It is really important you talk to them
                            and
                            tell them all you need.</p>
                        <p>If you are under 16 when you go to the the home office, the social worker will also be
                            present
                            during your welfare interview and when your photo and fingerprints are taken.
                            Your social worker should visit you at least every six weeks and attend all your Home Office
                            interviews.</p>

                        <h4>Responsible Adult</h4>
                        <p>A responsible adult should be present during your big (substantive)
                            interview. It is someone you trust- maybe your foster carer or sometimes someone for a
                            voluntary
                            sector organisation arranged by your solicitor. </p>
                        <p>The role of the Responsible Adult is mostly to
                            ensure that you understand the interview process and are well treated during the interview.
                            If
                            you are tired or thirsty or upset from all the questions, your Responsible Adult will ask
                            for
                            breaks during the interview. They will also intervene and help you if they feel the
                            interviewer
                            is being too harsh and making you sad. You can ask your Responsible Adult for help at any
                            time
                            during the interview is you are not feeling well or feel angry or sad.</p>

                            support you during the age assessment meetings by making sure you are treated well and will
                            look after your welfare (make sure you are feeling well during the meeting). </p>

                        <h4>Personal advisor (PA)</h4>
                        <p>Once you turn 16, your social worker is replaced by a Personal Advisor. Sometimes, you are
                            introduced to your PA at 16 but keep working with your social worker until you are 18. Your
                            PA can support you to achieve your plan for the future until you are 25. Your plan will now
                            be called a Pathway Plan. Your PA will review this plan with you regularly and ensure you
                            achieve what is in the plan. This plan should tell you all what has been done and what will
                            be done to support you with your asylum claim. Your PA will also advise you on education,
                            housing, money matters- everything you need to know when living well on your own. </p>

                        <p>Once social services accept to take care of you, they have to look for a family for you. The
                            family you will live you is called your foster family and the parents are the foster parents
                            or foster carers. In many cases, your foster carers will be the ones in charge of looking
                            for your solicitor and taking you to your appointments with the solicitors, to the Home
                            Office but also to the doctor, school and social services review meetings. They are
                            responsible for your care on a day-to-day basis. </p>

                        <h4>Legal representative</h4>
                        <p> This is the person you usually call your solicitor. The solicitor helps you prepare your
                            statement of evidence (the letter that explains why you want to claim asylum) and submit
                            your claim and any permitted appeals. You will see your solicitor many times when you put
                            together your statement of evidence and prepare for your big interview. They will also
                            represent you (be present and defend your case) during the big interview at the Home Office.
                            If there is a court appeal, your solicitor will most likely instruct a barrister to
                            represent you. In the UK, a legal representative can be any one of the following:
                            solicitors, barristers, caseworkers and immigration advisors in specialist law centres or
                            other organisations. They have to be registered with a regulated body to be able to
                            practice. </p>

                        <p>An advocate is here to help and support you express your wishes and feelings. They will make
                            sure you are involved in all decisions about your life and that your voice is heard and
                            taken into account. Advocates also help you speak out when things go wrong. They make sure
                            you know your rights and help you to get the support you need from social services by

                            is to assist you in accessing quality legal representation and guide you through the
                            complexities of the asylum procedures, as well as building a support network for you. </p>

                            meeting where you all discuss the progress of your care plan and any problems you may have.

                        <p>In the UK, you will hear the word GP instead of doctor. This is the doctor you can see when
                            you first arrive and whenever you feel unwell or sick or are worried about something. It is
                            all free. Your foster carer will register you with a GP as soon as you arrive. You will also
                            have a first meeting with a special GP on arrival- just to check if you’ve been hurt during
                            your journey to the UK or have all your injections (vaccinations). It’s really important you
                            go this first visit (it’s called Initial Health Assessment) because it is your chance to get
                            some help with anything that is hurting, making you feel worried or in pain.

                            education. For instance, they can organise some additional English classes for you. When you
                            are post 16 (after year 11) and in college, they may not always be able to organise extra
                            English classes for you but they can advise you about studies, new courses or work
                            experience and find other type of support for you with the voluntary sector.

                        <p>Sometimes, people do not feel well because their bodies have been hurt or are sick, and other
                            times, they do not feel so well inside. It also happens that you do not feel too well in
                            both your body and mind (feelings and emotions). For example, you may have problems sleeping
                            or headaches or tummy pains and you do not know why. It might be because you are very
                            worried or stressed. If this happens, a counsellor can help you by listening to you or
                            giving you ideas to cope with these feelings and pains. A counsellor is a person who helps
                            you find ways to cope when you feel sad or anxious, when you are worried about something.
