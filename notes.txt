client notes 02-10-20
 I don't think she likes the dark background. I think she'd prefer a white or very light background or backgrounds
 She'd like the text throughout the site to be contained. My word. In other (better) words she wants a border
 Text is free flowing and there is no border"

**Missing section**
"Problem cards should be laid underneath the page content like a deck of cards"

"I don't like the purple"

"Claim Asylum headline text to be larger

She referenced the Coram voice website (https://coramvoice.org.uk/) and said she likes the lightness and the illustration (edited) 

She said the titles should be bigger

She'd like spaces between the items on https://rcopestake65.github.io/right_to_remain_dev/overview.html

She likes the Right to Remain Toolkit (https://righttoremain.org.uk/toolkit/) because it's "light" (edited)
